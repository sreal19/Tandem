DH Praxis Technology Log
Week 1
Made tentative decision to go with Python 3.4
Python 2.7 already installed
Python 3.4 already installed
PyCharm IDE already installed

PYJAMAS PACKAGE
I dowloaded pyjamas package with the intent in order to use it as our GUI/Web front end 
per a suggestion made by Chris.
Though I had previously installed a couple of other GUI packages (tkinter and PyQT),
I successfully downloaded pyjamas source from pyjs.org. The installation required 
Unix command line and though I struggled, I got it to apparently install on my 2.7
Python environment. I say apparently because I did not have an easy way to test it.
However I could not install on 3.4 environment.

In consultation with two of the Digital Fellows, I revised my plan to use Python 3.4 and
switched to 2.7, uninstalling all 3.4 folders and files.

INSTALL FEATURE EXTRACTOR
code.google.com/p/softwarestudies/w/list is the SoftwareStudies wiki.
Click the Installation link
This installation requires pre installing XCode and MacPorts.
I did those installs on my desktop and laptop and then followed the step by step 
instructions for installing Feature Extractor.

Got stuck when it came to Matlab. License required.
